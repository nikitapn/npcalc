  <h1 class="chapter">FAQ</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>How do I create a new calculation based on an existing solution?</li>
    <p>Go to the 'SOLUTIONS'; Each row of the table here starts with an icon that looks like a gear; click on it!</p>
    <li>Can I add my own nutrition formula and fertilizer?</li>
    <p>Yes, you can! To do that, please register your hydrosoft account â€” it's completely free.</p>
    <li>Some of my calculated weights of fertilizers have negative values. What should I do?</li>
    <p>Rethink your fertilizers participating in the calculation. The calculator solves the problem using a straightforward analytical method that does allow negative values as a result of a computation. Typically, this happens if your fertilizer set is redefined, if you know what I mean.</p>
    <li>What are those sliders next to each element on the 'CALCULATOR' page?</li>
    <p>The sliders represent the significants of each element. It makes sense to play with them if you are missing some fertilizers to make a complete solution; otherwise, there is no reason to touch them.</p>
    <li>What sources should I read to understand more about this calculator?</li>
    <p>Read 'Nutrient Solutions for Greenhouse Crops'; It contains adequate information about the subject. Some calculation formulas were borrowed from that article.</p>
  </ul>
